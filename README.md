## Description

This webpage is designed to take a number from the user and return a count up to the number entered with a few exceptions. While the numbers are counted up to the inputted number, if the number is divisible by 3, that number will be replaced with the word "ping". If the number is divisible by 5, the number will be replaced with pong. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it will be replaced with the word "pingpong".

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Enter a number into the "Enter your number here" field
* Click the PingPong! button to submit your number
