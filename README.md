# Ping-Pong-Independent-Project
#### JavaScripts Project, 06.23.2019

#### By **Celia Baptiste**

## Description

This webpage is designed to take a number from the user and return a count up to the number entered with a few exceptions. While the numbers are counted up to the inputted number, if the number is divisible by 3, that number will be replaced with the word "ping". If the number is divisible by 5, the number will be replaced with pong. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it will be replaced with the word "pingpong".

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Enter a number into the "Enter your number here" field
* Click the PingPong! button to submit your number

## Specifications
* It can count up to the provided numbers
  * Example Input: 5
  * Example Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
* It will evaluate the numbers being counted and determine whether they are divisible by 3 and display ping in that numbers position.
  * Example Input: 6
  * Example Output: ping
* It will evaluate the numbers being counted and determine whether they are divisible by 5 and display pong in that numbers position.
  * Example Input: 10
  * Example Output: pong
* It will evaluate the numbers being counted and determine whether they are divisible by 3 and 5 and display pingpong in that numbers position.
  * Example Input: 30
  * Example Output: pingpong

## Known Bugs

*I've tried various combinations of code. In the console I can get the loop to count up to the inputted number, but when it comes to running the code to insert ping, pong, and pingpong, the code is not yet running correctly. No output as well. I did get an error output under the submit button at one point. Still working on figuring out the solution.*
